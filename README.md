#  espeak-ng

This Homebrew tap provides formulae for [eSpeak NG](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng),
a fork of the eSpeak speech synthesizer.

As I remove any build oddities, my goal is to supersede this repo and contribute these formulae back to `homebrew-core`.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install anarchivist/espeak-ng/<formula>`

Or `brew tap anarchivist/espeak-ng` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
